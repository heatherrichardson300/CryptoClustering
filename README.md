# CryptoClustering

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency market data and determine whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The analysis involves clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means and optimizing the clustering process with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Code Location
The code for this project is located in the `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. It includes data loading, preprocessing, clustering analysis, and visualization steps.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- hvPlot
- Matplotlib
